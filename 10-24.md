Make work more joyful.

## Dharmesh Shah, HubSpot founder

Binary decisions good. Flexible ranges, bad; Binary, good.

Culture is like an Operating System.

Why do I need to know to write a function.
What are the things that are correlated?

Companies build 2 products:
1 for their customers,
1 for their employees

"We build intuitive solutions, better than before."

It's a lie. You have to know the domain of what you want to do, then you have to
know HOW to do the thing you want to do in the software, and then make it happen
in the software.

The future of ChatGPT is to ask it to create the software to solve the problem
you want, instead of having to know how to use a tool.

- LLVMs put out text. That's what we code in.

- This is the next BIG transformation.

- Move toward an augmented AI direction, with domain prompts to build easier.

Allow developers to work at higher levels of abstraction.

- What if some of your code was just English, describing a function that does this.
  - You don't need the code details, it's a layer of abstraction.

  - Writing a for loop in visual tool is not really no-code.

### Developer collaboration

Communication vs Collaboration - they're not the same thing.

Communication falls under collaboration, but not the same.

Gathering and sharing info, understand requirements, conversation enables and
empowers the collaboration which is more organized into larger features or
goals that rely on communication loops.

Stereotype of the rock star dev getting it done with red bulls. But you need
writing skills to communicate to stakeholders/marketers/etc. So no one is deving
in a hole.

Nothing is like a face to face conversion, including going for a walk and
getting coffee, which is tough with distributed teams.

- Watch out for tone in chat, micro-communication w/emojis

- There's a generational gap in emoji usage.

- There's a business etiquette to emoji. They are different at work than
  w/friends.

- Sync, live communication is not as useful. Async communications are heavily
  important for collaboration.

- The most popular tools are made by devs for devs, but that asynch
communication spills over in popularity.

- Big problem: dependency management, workflows, inevitably create bottlenecks.
  Need to work in more independent, parallel streams.
  Use an API connection and work in parallel, reduces bottleneck.
  Loose coupling!

  Every team should be treated like an API. We should decouple/reduce/remove
  dependencies and blockers. -- idea from the CEO at Postman via Joyce Lin
  
  Relying on asynch comms and neglecting the sync comms ignores informal feedback
  Need a balance. When there's a problem, it's when there's an inbalance between
  communication and human element. Just make sure you have processes for both
  sync and async in place to maintain the balance.

## A conversation on mental health

There is similarity across various communities, like acting/hollywood and tech
industry.

Coming out of Covid, there's no where that's not appropriate to talk about
mental health. Going through Covid was a trauma.

But we still have so much mental stress, disconnected, screens, social media, is
just so much a part of our lives and the problem now.

The most stress is trying to get the job, being on the treadmill and having to
hustle to get the job. You're fighting to get the audition/interview versus the
sense of I belong here.

How do you not take criticism personally? Focus on other things, hobbies,
activities, etc. It's a way to separate from the up/down mental roller coater.

Knowing your way back to center when your thoughts are swirling or negative
energy is building.

- Folks in the tech world seem more numb, we spend so much time on our own, in
  our own pod, inside ourselves a lot.
- Learn to identify the feelings, behaviors, patterns of your bad behavior.
- If you can recognize what you experience when your in a bad place v good
  place, and you know where your sweet spot is of function, then you can try to
  draw a line to move away from your bad place toward that good spot. (It may take
  a lifetime to develop.)

No real work or value is accomplished if you're not challenged and it comes with
a cost. That's what wisdom is, it comes from navigating those experiences
whether successful or failure.

Burnout

- What have you done for me lately.
- People think that's deficient, and there's something wrong with you.
- Fuck that. Burnout is not bad. It's achievement. You will recover. You will do
  more.
- Maybe it's better to recognize whether that burnout is in the interest in
  something versus just habit.
- You can't ignore or run from it. So be aware of it.

Helping other people

- Positive mental health is good to be aware of too. Helping others, with a
  task, with anything.
- Actors facilitate an emotional journey with you. Catharsis is the end of an
  emotional journey. The goal is that you're creating something meaningful.
- When you know there's value, you're willing to work harder, go deeper.

Thanks for our work

- Our work life has animated our lives for decades.

## Mono vs Multi Repo

Challenges w/dependency management in monorepos.

- They tend to want to own the entire project including external dependencies.
- Dependencies may be build with many other tools, packaging systems, etc.
- Helps to have a community of devs to help or build standards.
- Which versions of dependencies. In monorepos, tend to use a single version and
  avoid diamond versions
- Does Multi make that better? If you link against them, then you only made the
problem more challenging dealing with multiple repos.
- Mono repo, updating a dependency in a central place, makes everything slightly
  slower, but has benefits like doing license checking once. They all get the
  new version at once, but they all have more work to do to upgrade at once.

Multiple changes, need to merge back with rebase. How to smooth out process after rebase?

- With a monorepo, you could have 100s more commits and conflicts across the repo at scale.
- Create merge queues, instead of merging into main directly, you temp merge
  first and run all your pipeline, fixes, etc before you then merge that into
  main.

Which approach better facilitates dev collaboration?

- Mono repo better, use shared components, see other components that everyone
  else is using, maybe you hadn't thought of.
- Forced to collaborate together as you deal with shared dependency upgrades.
- Explorability is positive and copy/paste others code examples that are out
  there.
- Everyone is checking in READMEs under their section, so it makes more
  collaborative for others to join working in that portion of the mono.

Use multiple monorepos! based on scope. It's quite commom. It's where you are on
the spectrum with the work. With the desire to move toward 1 mono. Sometimes it
makes sense on your organizational standards, and 1 repo may not make sense or
work well for different orgs across an organization.

Bazel, buck, pants, nix is needed to manage your mono at scale.

Trend: Will begin seeing more monorepos in organizations over time.

- How will OSS change for this will be interesting to see.

## Evolving the Developer Experience

Marketing discussion about GitKraken.
Work is divided across multiple systems across different tools. Lot of context
switching throughout workflow.
Gitkraken wants to show all work, requests, repos, branches, etc. without
switching products.
Pinning pins items to the top. Adds snooze to bring it back later.

Cloud Patches (git patch)
Developers are collaborating way too late in the process.
Not until review stage. This is slower, ramp up time, rerunning build pipelines.
Move collaboration earlier in the dev stage, at plan and code stages.

A patch is a collaboration mechanism. It is from original git, but on it's own,
it's horrible slow and inefficient.

- Elevate the patch to allow better collaboration and automation.
- Gitkraken stores patches with a link. What repo, merge request, tools etc.

### Dev productivity

Throughput rates are not the problem or metric to rely on, but can be indicators
or guides to find problems if patterns change. As soon as you make the metric
the goal, you kill it's usefulness and everyone else's value contribution. It
becomes a problem. The problems are often people problems.

Developer Experience (DevX).
Dev pairing/mentoring to have an advocate.
Good product owners and scrum masters can make or break a team.
Train people to be a shield. Meetings and managers inhibit devs.
Interrupted flow, constant meetings needs controlled.

Coverage is a negative metric. 100% doesn't mean it's valuable.

By the time the PR is open, it's often too late; and requires large refactoring.
It's better to pair program so the PR is more a formality.

### Story time

When branches are open too long, they have too much code to review and
understand, and too many changes to merge.

- Must make small frequent changes.

### GitLens

Overview of vscode extension.

## Denis Pilarinos, Founder Unblocked

## Lessons from unblocking teams

Marketing.
Unblocked is a tool for sharing and communicating within large orgs. There's a
vs code extension that ties into that system and associates questions to your
systems.
