### Evolution of dev collaboration

1953 Grace Hopper, Send your improvements and we'll add them
1972 Bell Labs, Single user version control
1979 Merkle tree
1982 RCS version control, 1986 CVS added client/server
1991 Linux, first global scale distributed development
1992 Tim Berners-Lee, URL, vital for sharing
1992 CTAN, 93 pms, 94 dpkg, 95 CPAN package manager
1999 Kent Beck, Extreme programming, what is the culture of how we work together
1999 Sourceforge, OSS projects
2000 SVN, BitKeeper, 2005 git, git wins the version control wars
2003 NixOS, immutability, atomic upgrade, automation, scaling
2006 Amazon S3, cloud infrastructure

- "malloc for the internet"
- Allocate storage, store something, and reference it with a URL
2008 GitHub, centralized version control, invented pull requests, shares URLs
2009 DevOps Days, social movement, it's about how we work together
2010 npm, the largest package manager
2011 microservices
2013 Docker, build share run

It's about building culture and fits organizational structure, and solving
problems within the organization. It must fit into the culture and the way
people want to work.

Bring more context to the developer

- But context complexity grows
- When to bring things to the developer

Working on workflows

- How to better use bots to support automation

Supply chain attacks exploit the structure of the collaboration culture itself.

- Need to reinforce trust, so we can trust each other as we work together

Data and AI/ML models have brought new collaboration flows

We are now collaborating with AI

- Copilot, pair programming spirit
- Do you collaborate with AI like a team
- How do you build testing around your AI support

Make collaboration __simpler__.

- Collaborate in simpler ways.

## Focus View (in GitLens and GitKraken)

Focus view helps present you with tasks.

## Mike Miles, MIT Sloan (the management school)

### How productive teams harness AI as a development tool

Generative AI

- focused on generating human-like content
- trained on large TB of data
- Like predictive text

For programming,

- uses patterns and large sets of data (code) for AI models
- Reduce time consuming dev tasks
- Frees up devs for higher-level problem solving
- Huge emerging market of AI tools now

AI can be a team mate on your team

- It's the most knowledgable but least informed team member.
- Allow AI to crank out low level tasks
- Takes on dev-adjacent roles

AI is a rubber duck developer

- Sparks new ideas and approaches to problems
- Give it options and code snippets
- Conversational prompts help you practice explaining technical ideas and concepts clearly.
- Phind.com offers code suggestions - like ChatGPT just for devs

AI can be a reviewer

- Saves time flagging common problems.
- Will flag trivial, but also complex problems.
- Sugest improvements on best proactices, standards, and design patterns
- Codiga is static analysis and code review tool.
- Codium can suggest and write unit tests, plugin to IDE and writes for you.

AI can be a documentor

- Ensures code is will documented, easier to understand and share
- Provide analyis and explanation of 3rd party or legacy code. Feed it the code and ask it to explain it to you.
- Mintlify Doc Writer creates code documention

AI - time saver

- Saves dev time
- Generate realistic data, content, and images for use in lower level environments
- ChatGPT create tables of fake content, gone is lorem ipsom
- CodeWP used to scaffold wordpress plugins
- Bugasura tracks/manages bugs and issues

Considerations

- Only produces out that "looks" correct. Generated code may not be correct
- Always review, test and verify AI results
- Data provided might be used for further training, careful of your data
- AI content is not copyrighted (in the US)
  - What does that do to your licensing for your projects.
  - Legal gray area right now

## Git

Can add browser extension for GitKaken and flow between GitKraken and web.

## Mish Manners, GitHub Advocate

### GitHub Copilot

AI mimics problem solving and decision making. like JARVIS from Marvel.

Helpful peer programmer. It's not just autocomplete. It's trying to synthesize
what you need based on your context.

You're still responsible for what it provides.

It works with several languages.

Built right into the IDE. Can install VS code and authenticate with GitHub.

Using github copilot, write comments to help prompt what you need explaining the
problem

It will use context from the comments and code that are in your file or your
project folder structure

GitHub Copilot Beta - is more conversational. Prompts questions and given steps
for how to proceed.

- You can ask simple things too like how do I add that file, it will give you
  step by step instructions for adding files to a project.

## Time (GitKraken marketing)

The longer your code stays out of main, the more complicated it gets.

GitKraken helps show you how many merge requests are open and how they move.
Use GitKaken Insights.

## Frank Boucher, GitKraken Ambassador

### Ditch USB keys and embrace git

Beginner intro to using git

## GitKraken workspace marketing

GitKraken workspaces manage a group of repos.

## Jason Gates, Sandia National Laboratories, DevOps evangelist

### When workflows don't feel like work

Discussion about incorporating git into the govt national labs.

Teams entrenched in their tools and didn't want to change.
They worked hard to incorporate and transition teams.
The culture is hard to change.

## Chuck Dries, Adobe; Melise, GitKraken; Keith, GitKraken

### Code history deciphered w/GitLens

Demo using GitLens, see value in different feature

## Jokes

why dev go broke ?The lost all their cache.

Why coulnd't hibt debug the code, because it was elvish script

## Ambily Kavumkal, GitHub

### Increased role of non-functional pilots

Generative AI for non-functional requirements (NFRs)

Need to be familiar with different NFRs in different domains, data access,
security, etc.

Demos how to use GitHub Copilot to improve performance, see suggestions provided.
Asked for security suggestions
Asked to refactor for readability
Asked to add documentation
Refactor my code for strategy pattern

## Audrey Long, Microsoft

### Thread modeling

Threat modeling is an adversarial view of a system.

Went through examples of threat modeling star wars, death star, storm troopers.
Interesting and silly.

## Rizel Scarlett, tbd

### How containers promote equity in Tech

Changed "master" to "main". It was well intentioned not had little, to no impact.

More than 70% of teams are white. 39% of women felt voices unheard.
DEI roles slowing disappearing. Industry deprioritizing DEI.
Explained privilege.
Equality v Equity
Containers
Barrier to entry, stunted growth and inclusivity
Containers provide more Access, reduce barriers to start
