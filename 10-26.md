### Not all Tech debt is created equal

Monolith may seem to be avoided. They break every code into a separate
microservice. There are virtues building in a simple box, packaging, releasing,
etc. assuming proper sharding is in place.

Risk of creating tremendous tech debt not worth paying for.

Lengthy complicated specifications aren't really worth it. However, docs for
consumers is critical. Documenting your systems, architecture, etc, is not worth
it.

Every line of code is tech debt. Technology fades continually.
Customers don't care what architecture you use, what tech you use, as long as you can
continue to innovate to make it better.
Prototypes are quick to build but will never scale.

### What must be paid

Dependencies that are being deprecated. AWS, etc, will sunset old services.
Must be paid asap. Security tools, upgrading dependencies constantly.

Migrating everything into some other language, may not be valuable. What's the
motivation. Do you really need to do it? Does it support the devs or the
business?

Focus on slow workflows, bottlenecks that devs must deal with. Excessively slow
builds, pipeline stages, deploy steps, etc. Waiting for later stages to fail.
This is tech debt worth burning down.

"Technical debt is just a difference of opinion between two developers."

### Why does it take more than just code

Initially, work on writing the best code with the best tools. But software that
people want to use is more than that. It's important for managing costs, but
most code will service the individuals using the system. You don't need to build
for features that might never be realized or used. 80% rule.

Software will be useful for customers if it meets customer needs, not if the
code is pretty or fun.

You'll write and rewrite code over and over again. It will tune toward the
customer needs, not the way developers want to take it.

Ideation, wire framing, UX, prototype, Ideation, design polish, backend features
to get MPV. Then do feedback cycles with customers.

- Learn to say no inside each phase, say no to features to build what's
  critical. You can add features later. But only if you can say no.

Ideation - what are you building and what. Simplest definition to meet need.
- Focus on critical to value.

Wire framing

- Napkin to figma
- It's about organizing visually
- How will a user navigate the experience

UX - as apps become very complex, figure out what belongs front in center vs
outside, secondary, dropdowns, etc.

Clickable prototype

Then code up the features you've identified.

### How to adapt to unknown

Developing for unknown set of requirements, changing requirements, customers
that come in later.

Just talked about Scrum, sprints, scrums w/stakeholders. Their teams are very
fluid, so the teams form for an effort for several sprints. They often share
team members across multiple scrum teams at the same time. (Ick!)

Repeatedly run into the unknown unknowns. Can't predict environments in advance.
Often customers have varying infrastructure and deployments.

They avoid different, special branches for every customer need. They focus
solely on rolling the change into the main line and release single set of work
to everyone on next release.

Release notes is something deficient enough to communicate to customers (not
every commit or change). It implies that change really needs polished and
finished.

## Shauna O'neil, Dodgy Code

### Better communications between developers

Code comments, function comment blocks
Readmes: description, techs/libs used, contributing, bug reporting, top level
explanations, relevant project links, contact

"It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing."
- Boromir, LOTR

Git commit messages. Break up commits as small as possible, changes should only
include what the comment states. If you include multiple different changes in a
commit, split them into separate commits.

Be consistent. Establish patterns in communication. And make sure you continue
to do everything. Do add commits that say "made changes". Don't be a Boromir.

### Shift in Governance, from ownership to independence

Transitioning from private corporate ownership to public ownership.

## Harsh Mishra, localstack

### Shift left on IAM testing & Security locally

Perform validations, security/vulnerability checks in pipeline.

75% breaches caused by Permission management.

Setup local cloud emulators (local stack company provides)

## Comm & Coll Elevate

## Devfluence

<missed>

## Domagoj Vidovic, @techwisdom

### Beyond coding

<waste>

He has 750k followers and shared his "journey"
Online businesses didn't work out for him. Tech niche on social media.
He focused on social media content, quit his job, and makes more money with
social media than coding. And you can too!
It's easy and cheap to start a side hustle.
LOL

### Nix

Use to manage your dev environments, dependencies, for build.

Declarative, generic, just correct enough.

npm (or whatever package manager)
There are things that aren't npm or in npm registries.
npm won't install it for you.
So then, apt-get install or dnf install in a dockerfile.

Just correct enough
Docker image is ready for your build, but then you want to edit your code.
DevContainers allows you to work on this, but it's costly and complex.

Nix is not isolated container like docker, just an isolated environment on your
existing machine. You can create a clean environment.

Missing something like pkg-config.
Create nix file.
Define dev shell in source. Add packages you need.
Then open that nix-shell.
